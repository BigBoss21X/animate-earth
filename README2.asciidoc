This repository is an experiment in applying optical-flow-based motion interpolation to pre-processed RGB satellite imagery from Himawari-8's AHI imager, with the aim of regularly producing high-quality smoothed videos from these images, and sharing them with the world. The final products can be found on this Youtube channel, updated nearly daily.
